## :scroll: Description
Pick a puppy, know him better... and keep the desire of getting it to your home forever


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This is my Compose Hello world. I tried to integrate it with other Jetpack libraries like Paging 3. It was super fun to finally put the hands on it.
Not proud at all cause it finished being an architectural disaster and I have no time to "fix it", but definitely happy to get to know Compose better.
